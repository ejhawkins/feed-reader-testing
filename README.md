Feed Reader READ ME.


Before we can successfully run the app. The app would need to pass the following tests. First are all the feeds loaded and running on the application. You can test it by running the allFeeds function. Next we need to make sure the menu and canvas are working properly. You can easily test that as it is used with class names and links. After that let's test that all the feeds are loading to the application properly. Once all these tasks are checked and completely the web app will be ready to go live. 


Getting Started
Get the index file up and running by simply open the index.html and scroll to the bottom. To edit the test please take a look at the feedreader.js file.
